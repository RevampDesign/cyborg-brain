title: 3 Factors Contributing to Flow

#literaturenote 

## Discipline
Reigning in the urge to keep chasing [[Smaller Sooner, Larger Later|smaller-sooners]] or the new shiny thing. (Reminds me of [[Chris Do]]'s acronym for FOCUS: [[Follow One Course Until Successful]])

## Detachment
Not allowing the external to impact your discipline / worth / goals / path. This includes avoiding the anger-response when things appear unfair or personal. [[How can I remove my worth's dependence on my work?]] 

## Play
Play is a teaching and training tool for all animals. It adds motivation to our discipline. It creates an environment that *could* help with detachment if it really is all about play. Play is probably heightened in effectiveness and fun when there is that detachment component (i.e. not competitive to the point of forgetting play and attaching [[identity]] to performance).
